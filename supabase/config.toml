# This file allows per-function settings to be consistent across deployments,
# so you don't have to remember CLI flags like --no-verify-jwt.

# Cloudflare Email Routing authenticates via a shared secret (Authorization: Bearer <CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_SECRET>),
# not a Supabase JWT, so JWT verification must be disabled for this function.
