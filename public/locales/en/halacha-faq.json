    {
      "question": "From what exactly is ma'aser separated?",
      "answer": "Ma'aser is separated from all types of income: salary, business profits, interest, monetary gifts, inheritance, and more. A rabbi should be consulted for special cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it permissible to pay debts from ma'aser funds?",
      "answer": "As a rule, one should not pay existing debts or obligations from ma'aser funds. The ma'aser is intended for charity and not for paying personal debts."
    },
    {
      "question": "To whom can ma'aser funds be given?",
      "answer": "Ma'aser funds are primarily intended for the poor, but can also be donated to Torah institutions, free-loan societies (Gemachim), and for the support of Torah. A rabbi should be consulted regarding specific purposes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is separating Ma'aser Kesafim a biblical obligation?",
      "answer": "No, most authorities hold that Ma'aser Kesafim (tithing money) is not a biblical obligation. It is considered an ancient and good custom, at most a rabbinic requirement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it permissible to test G-d with Ma'aser Kesafim?",
      "answer": "Yes. Uniquely, with the mitzvah of ma'aser, it is permissible to 'test' G-d by giving tithes with the expectation of receiving the promised blessing of abundance in return, as stated in the verse in Malachi (3:10)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should be done in case of doubt when calculating ma'aser?",
      "answer": "Since Ma'aser Kesafim is not a full biblical obligation, one may be lenient in cases of doubt. If you are unsure about a specific income, expense, or donation, or if there is a dispute among authorities, you may follow the more lenient opinion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does a person with debts need to separate ma'aser?",
      "answer": "A person with debts is generally exempt from separating ma'aser if doing so would make it difficult to repay the debts. Paying one's debts takes precedence. However, giving small amounts to charity is still encouraged."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should one separate ma'aser from gifts or inheritance?",
      "answer": "One does not need to tithe gifts or inheritances of physical items or real estate. However, if one receives a monetary gift or inheritance, it should be tithed as regular income."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can living expenses (food, rent) be deducted before separating ma'aser?",
      "answer": "No, routine living expenses like food, clothing, and rent cannot be deducted from income before calculating ma'aser. In contrast, expenses incurred directly for earning a livelihood (e.g., travel to work) can be deducted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is income tax considered a recognized expense for ma'aser?",
      "answer": "Yes, income tax is generally considered a recognized expense that can be deducted before calculating ma'aser. However, other taxes like residential property tax are usually not deductible as one receives direct services in return."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it permissible to use ma'aser funds for mitzvos I am obligated to perform?",
      "answer": "No. Ma'aser funds cannot be used to fulfill personal obligations, including commandments like buying tefillin, a lulav and esrog, or giving required matanos la'evyonim on Purim. Ma'aser is for charity beyond one's personal obligations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'chomesh' and how does it differ from ma'aser?",
      "answer": "Chomesh is the practice of separating 20% of one's income for charity, as opposed to the 10% of ma'aser. It is considered a more meritorious level of giving. The laws regarding chomesh are often more lenient than those for ma'aser, for example, in defining deductible expenses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it permissible to separate more than chomesh (20%)?",
      "answer": "No. The Sages instituted a rule not to give more than a fifth (20%) of one's income to charity, to prevent a person from becoming needy themselves. In exceptional cases, a rabbi should be consulted."
