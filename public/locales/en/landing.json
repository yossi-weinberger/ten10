The institute guided the entire development process and approved the accuracy of all halachic calculations in the system. Over a long period, the institute published various versions of Excel tables for tithe and chomesh calculations, which gained great public popularity with over 3,500 orders in Israel. Following the high demand and numerous requests, the institute decided to collaborate with an expert programmer to create a completely new system – modern, convenient, and advanced – that incorporates all the advantages of previous versions, alongside upgrades and new functions that will provide a fast, accurate, and pleasant user experience.",
